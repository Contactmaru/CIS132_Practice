        <p>Hello, my name is Min Soo Kim. I am currently a returnee and back to college to learn computer science and computer information systems. My hobbies are reading, playing video games and adventuring out and about. I also like to cook a bit and learning a little by little. I also like to work on computers and to socialize with people. I hope to learn how to build better websites and learn to use CSS in detail. </p>
